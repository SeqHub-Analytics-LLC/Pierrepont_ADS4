# 🧪 Homework 1: FastAPI Hands-On Assessment

This is the first hands-on FastAPI assignment designed to help you practice building, validating, and interacting with RESTful APIs using Python and FastAPI.


## 📌 Objective

You will build a RESTful API for a **sports application** that manages a restaurant data and extends into real-world features like order management and menu management. The tasks will help you reinforce core FastAPI concepts including:

- Creating endpoints with `GET` and `POST`
- Using **Pydantic models** and **validation**
- Working with **path and query parameters**
- Applying **enumerations**, **custom validators**, and **field serializers**
- Simulating a database with in-memory lists

---

## 📁 Directory Structure

Your solution must be pushed to:

```
part_3/homework1/
```

Include your `main.py`, any helper files or models, and a `README.md` (if you want to add extra notes or explanations).

## ✅ Submission Checklist

- [ ] All endpoints are implemented correctly
- [ ] Validations and Enums are used where required
- [ ] JSON is returned in responses using response models
- [ ] In-memory lists simulate databases
- [ ] Proper use of field-level validation and custom serializers
- [ ] Code is pushed to `part_3/homework1/` on GitHub
