# ðŸš€ Exploring APIs and Model Deployment with FastAPI

## Module Overview
Welcome to an immersive journey into the world of Web APIs and Model Deployment! This module is designed to transform your understanding of how modern web services and machine learning models communicate and interact through robust API architectures.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- **Understand API Fundamentals:** Grasp the core concepts of RESTful APIs and web service architecture
- **Master JSON Responses:** Learn how to structure and parse JSON data effectively
- **Develop with FastAPI:** Create scalable, high-performance web APIs using Python's FastAPI framework
- **Implement Pydantic Validation:** Utilize advanced data validation techniques with Pydantic models
- **Deploy Machine Learning Models:** Transform your ML models into accessible web services
- **Generate Automatic API Documentation:** Use Swagger UI for interactive API documentation

## ðŸ“š Module Content Roadmap

- RESTful API design principles
- HTTP methods and status codes
- JSON as a data interchange format

### 2. FastAPI Fundamentals
- Setting up FastAPI projects
- Creating basic endpoints
- Path parameters
- Request and response models

### 3. Pydantic Models and Validation
- Data validation techniques
- Creating robust input and output models
- Error handling and custom validation
- Type hints

### 4. Machine Learning Model Deployment
- Preparing ML models for web serving
- Creating prediction endpoints
- Performance considerations
- Containerization and scaling

### 5. Swagger UI and API Documentation
- Automatic documentation generation

## ðŸ›  Technical Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- FastAPI
- Pydantic
- uvicorn
- Optional: scikit-learn, tensorflow (for ML model deployment)

## Deliverables for Students
- Each part of this module has a PDF text and a set of coding challenges.
    - There are scripts containing the code discussed in the PDF texts. Likewise for each coding challenge, you are expected to:
      - Attempt the coding challenge, each in its own script.
      - Place them in their associated folder e.g part_1, part_2
       - Push the completed scripts to your branch.

## ðŸš¦ Getting Started: Repository and Branch Management

### Keeping Your Branch Updated

1. 3

#### Pulling Latest Changes from Main Branch

## ðŸ’¡ Best Practices
- Always work in your personal branch
- Pull upstream changes regularly to stay updated
- Commit frequently with clear, descriptive messages
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude virtual environment and local configuration files
- Never commit sensitive information like API keys or personal credentials
- Practice incremental development
- Write modular, reusable code
- Follow and read the PDF contents carefully.

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting
- **Stuck in a Merge Conflict?** 
  - Take a deep breath
  - Carefully review the conflicting sections
  - Ask for help from instructors or peers if needed
- **Virtual Environment Not Working?**
  - Ensure you're using the correct Python version
  - Check that all dependencies are compatible
  - Recreate the virtual environment if necessary
